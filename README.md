* The dataset contains details of 50 startup companies.

### Dataset:
* It has 4 features
* Target variable is a continuous data (Profit amount)

### Data preprocessing:
* Encoding, EDA

### Modelling:
* using Linear Regression
   * got an R2 score of 90%
* using XGBoost:
   * at learning rate=0.2, I got a CV score of 90%.
* So, both Linear Regression and XGBoost shows that both models perform equally good in predicting the profits.
